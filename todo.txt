-- figure out what in misc.cpp belongs where
  -- just triangulate_faces and reverse_orientation left
-- eventually get around to pip install seagullmesh[core,corefine] etc
-- pull out indices.hpp from seagullmesh.hpp

-- move define_simple_type, define_array_type to hpp file so every module can define types
    - move princ_curv_etc into its own module

-- rename .mesh to .core
-- move Point2, Point3, etc out of .mesh into .core_types

-- get rid of setup.py in favor of CMakeLists
