-- figure out what in misc.cpp belongs where
-- eventually get around to pip install seagullmesh[core,corefine] etc
-- move define_simple_type, define_array_type to hpp file so every module can define types
    - move princ_curv_etc into its own module
-- rename .mesh to .core
-- move Point2, Point3, etc out of .mesh into .core_types
